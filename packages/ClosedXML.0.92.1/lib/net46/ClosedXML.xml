            <remarks>
            If you are going to evaluate the same expression several times,
            it is more efficient to parse it only once using the <see cref="M:ClosedXML.Excel.CalcEngine.CalcEngine.Parse(System.String)"/>

            <remarks>
            Identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore, which may be followed by
            additional letters, underscores, or digits. This string allows you to specify
            additional valid characters such as ':' or '!' (used in Excel range references
            for example).

            Gets an external object based on an identifier.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This method is useful when the engine needs to create objects dynamically.
            For example, a spreadsheet calc engine would use this method to dynamically create cell
            range objects based on identifiers that cannot be enumerated at design time
            (such as "AB12", "A1:AB12", etc.)

            <remarks>
            Once a DataContext is set, all public properties of the object become available
            to the CalcEngine, including sub-properties such as "Address.Street". These may
            be used with expressions just like any other constant.
