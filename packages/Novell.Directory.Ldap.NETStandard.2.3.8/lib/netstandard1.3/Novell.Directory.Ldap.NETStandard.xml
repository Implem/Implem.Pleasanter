            <summary>
                The class that creates a connection to the Ldap server. After the
                connection is made, a thread is created that reads data from the
                connection.
                The application's thread sends a request to the MessageAgent class, which
                creates a Message class.  The Message class calls the writeMessage method
                of this class to send the request to the server. The application thread
                will then query the MessageAgent class for a response.
                The reader thread multiplexes response messages received from the
                server to the appropriate Message class. Each Message class
                has its own message queue.
                Unsolicited messages are process separately, and if the application
                has registered a handler, a separate thread is created for that
                application's handler to process the message.
                Note: the reader thread must not be a "selfish" thread, since some
                operating systems do not time slice.

                    <li><code>getAttribute("cn")</code>      returns only the "cn" attribute</li>

                Returns a single best-match attribute, or <code>null</code> if no match is
                available in the entry.
                Ldap version 3 allows adding a subtype specification to an attribute
                name. For example, "cn;lang-ja" indicates a Japanese language
                subtype of the "cn" attribute and "cn;lang-ja-JP-kanji" may be a subtype
                of "cn;lang-ja". This feature may be used to provide multiple
                localizations in the same directory. For attributes which do not vary
                among localizations, only the base attribute may be stored, whereas
                for others there may be varying degrees of specialization.
                For example, <code>getAttribute(attrName,lang)</code> returns the
                <code>LdapAttribute</code> that exactly matches attrName and that
                best matches lang.
                If there are subtypes other than "lang" subtypes included
                in attrName, for example, "cn;binary", only attributes with all of
                those subtypes are returned. If lang is <code>null</code> or empty, the
                method behaves as getAttribute(attrName). If there are no matching
                attributes, <code>null</code> is returned.
                Assume the entry contains only the following attributes:
                <ul>
                    <li>cn;lang-en</li>
                    <li>cn;lang-ja-JP-kanji</li>
                    <li>sn</li>
                </ul>
                Examples:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>getAttribute( "cn" )</code>       returns <code>null</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>getAttribute( "sn" )</code>       returns the "sn" attribute.</li>

                        <code>getAttribute( "cn", "lang-en-us" )</code>
                        returns the "cn;lang-en" attribute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>getAttribute( "cn", "lang-en" )</code>
                        returns the "cn;lang-en" attribute.

                        <code>getAttribute( "cn", "lang-ja" )</code>

                The central class that encapsulates the connection
                to a directory server through the Ldap protocol.
                LdapConnection objects are used to perform common Ldap
                operations such as search, modify and add.
                In addition, LdapConnection objects allow you to bind to an
                Ldap server, set connection and search constraints, and perform
                several other tasks.
                An LdapConnection object is not connected on
                construction and can only be connected to one server at one
                port. Multiple threads may share this single connection, typically
                by cloning the connection object, one for each thread. An
                application may have more than one LdapConnection object, connected
                to the same or different directory servers.

                Thrown to indicate that an Ldap exception has occurred. This is a general
                exception which includes a message and an Ldap result code.
                An LdapException can result from physical problems (such as
                network errors) as well as problems with Ldap operations detected
                by the server. For example, if an Ldap add operation fails because of a
                duplicate entry, the server returns a result code.
                Five possible sources of information are available from LdapException:
                <dl>
                    <dt>Result Code:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <code>getResultCode</code> method returns a result code,
                        which can be compared against standard Ldap result codes.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Message:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <code>getMessage</code> method returns a localized message
                        from the message resource that corresponds to the result code.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Ldap server Message:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <code>getLdapErrorMessage</code> method returns any error
                        message received from the Ldap server.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Matched DN:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <code>getMatchedDN</code> method retrieves the part of a
                        submitted distinguished name which could be matched by the server
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Root Cause:</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The <code>getCause</code> method returns the a nested exception
                        that was the original cause for the error.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                The <code>ToString</code> method returns a string containing all
                the above sources of information, if they have a value.
                Exceptions generated by the API, i.e. that are not a result
                of a server response, can be identified as
                <tt>
                    instanceof
                    {@link LdapLocalException}

                The following table lists the standard Ldap result codes.
                See RFC2251 for a discussion of the meanings of the result codes.

                <code>setTag</code> method.
                Tags are set by the application and not by the API or the server.
                If a server response <code>isRequest() == false</code> has no tag,
                the tag associated with the corresponding server request is used.

            <summary>
                Sets a string identifier tag for this message.
                This method allows an API to set a tag and later identify messages
                by retrieving the tag associated with the message.
                Tags are set by the application and not by the API or the server.
                Message tags are not included with any message sent to or received
                from the server.
                Tags set on a request to the server
                are automatically associated with the response messages when they are
                received by the API and transferred to the application.
                The application can explicitly set a different value in a
                response message.
                To set a value in a server request, for example an
                {@link LdapSearchRequest}, you must create the object,
                set the tag, and use the
                {@link LdapConnection.SendRequest LdapConnection.sendRequest()}
                method to send it to the server.

            <summary>
                A single add, delete, or replace operation to an LdapAttribute.
                An LdapModification contains information on the type of modification
                being performed, the name of the attribute to be replaced, and the new
                value.  Multiple modifications are expressed as an array of modifications,
                i.e., <code>LdapModification[]</code>.
                An LdapModification or an LdapModification array enable you to modify
                an attribute of an Ldap entry. The entire array of modifications must
                be performed by the server as a single atomic operation in the order they
                are listed. No changes are made to the directory unless all the operations
                succeed. If all succeed, a success result is returned to the application.
                It should be noted that if the connection fails during a modification,
                it is indeterminate whether the modification occurred or not.
                There are three types of modification operations: Add, Delete,
                and Replace.
                <b>Add: </b>Creates the attribute if it doesn't exist, and adds
                the specified values. This operation must contain at least one value, and
                all values of the attribute must be unique.
                <b>Delete: </b>Deletes specified values from the attribute. If no
                values are specified, or if all existing values of the attribute are
                specified, the attribute is removed. Mandatory attributes cannot be
                removed.
                <b>Replace: </b>Creates the attribute if necessary, and replaces
                all existing values of the attribute with the specified values.
                If you wish to keep any existing values of a multi-valued attribute,
                you must include these values in the replace operation.
                A replace operation with no value will remove the entire attribute if it
                exists, and is ignored if the attribute does not exist.

                Represents an Ldap Filter.
                This filter object can be created from a String or can be built up
                programatically by adding filter components one at a time.  Existing filter
                components can be iterated though.
                Each filter component has an integer identifier defined in this class.
                The following are basic filter components: {@link #EQUALITY_MATCH},
                {@link #GREATER_OR_EQUAL}, {@link #LESS_OR_EQUAL}, {@link #SUBSTRINGS},
                {@link #PRESENT}, {@link #APPROX_MATCH}, {@link #EXTENSIBLE_MATCH}.
                More filters can be nested together into more complex filters with the
                following filter components: {@link #AND}, {@link #OR}, {@link #NOT}
                Substrings can have three components:

             The only time a client will create a IntermediateResponse is when it is

             response sequence that follows the msgID in the PDU. The intermediate
             response draft defines this as:

             This constructor is written to handle both cases.

                The Base64 utility class performs base64 encoding and decoding.
                The Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding is designed to represent
                arbitrary sequences of octets in a form that need not be humanly
                readable.  The encoding and decoding algorithms are simple, but the
                encoded data are consistently only about 33 percent larger than the
                unencoded data.  The base64 encoding algorithm is defined by
                RFC 2045.

                Conversion table for encoding to base64.
                emap is a six-bit value to base64 (8-bit) converstion table.
                For example, the value of the 6-bit value 15
                is mapped to 0x50 which is the ASCII letter 'P', i.e. the letter P

                dmap is a base64 (8-bit) to six-bit value converstion table.
                For example the ASCII character 'P' has a value of 80.
                The value in the 80th position of the table is 0x0f or 15.
                15 is the original 6-bit value that the letter 'P' represents.
