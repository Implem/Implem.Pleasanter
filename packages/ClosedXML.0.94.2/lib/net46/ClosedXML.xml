            Identifiers must start with a letter or an underscore, which may be followed by
            additional letters, underscores, or digits. This string allows you to specify
            additional valid characters such as ':' or '!' (used in Excel range references

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This method is useful when the engine needs to create objects dynamically.
            For example, a spreadsheet calc engine would use this method to dynamically create cell
            range objects based on identifiers that cannot be enumerated at design time
            (such as "AB12", "A1:AB12", etc.)

            Once a DataContext is set, all public properties of the object become available
            to the CalcEngine, including sub-properties such as "Address.Street". These may
            be used with expressions just like any other constant.

            Implementation of QuadTree adapted to Excel worksheet specifics. Differences with the classic implementation
            are that the topmost level is split to 128 square parts (2 columns of 64 blocks, each 8192*8192 cells) and that splitting
            the quadrand onto 4 smaller quadrants does not depent on the number of items in this quadrant. When the range is added to the
            QuadTree it is placed on the bottommost level where it fits to a single quadrant. That means, row-wide and column-wide ranges
            are always placed at the level 0, and the smaller the range is the deeper it goes down the tree. This approach eliminates
            the need of trasferring ranges between levels.
